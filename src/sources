# The developer defines the TARGETNAME variable. It is the name of
# the target (component) that is being built by this makefile.
# It should not include any path or filename extension.
#
TARGETNAME=ijexp32
#
# The developer defines the TARGETPATH and TARGETTYPE variables.
# The first variable specifies where the target will be built. The second specifies
# the type of target (either PROGRAM, DYNLINK, LIBRARY, UMAPPL_NOLIB or
# BOOTPGM). Use UMAPPL_NOLIB when you are only building user-mode
# programs and do not need to build a library.
#
TARGETPATH=obj

# Select one of the following, and delete the others:
TARGETTYPE=DYNLINK
#
# The TARGETLIBS macro specifies additional libraries to link against your target
# image. Each library path specification should contain an asterisk (*)
# where the machine-specific subdirectory name should go.
#
TARGETLIBS=$(SDK_LIB_PATH)\kernel32.lib \
	$(SDK_LIB_PATH)\user32.lib \
	$(SDK_LIB_PATH)\shell32.lib \
	$(SDK_LIB_PATH)\comctl32.lib \
	$(SDK_LIB_PATH)\ole32.lib \
	$(SDK_LIB_PATH)\uuid.lib
#
# The INCLUDES variable specifies any include paths that are specific to
# this source directory. Separate multiple paths with single
# semicolons. Relative path specifications are okay.
#
INCLUDES=$(DDK_INC_PATH)
#
# The developer defines the SOURCES macro. It contains a list of all the
# source files for this component. Specify each source file on a separate
# line using the line-continuation character. This minimizes merge
# conflicts if two developers are adding source files to the same component.
